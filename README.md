# decxpert
The DecXpert software starts with a quick inspection of a new X-ray image. It normalizes the image to correct for input from various modalities, and then detects the abnormalities that may be related to chest conditions. The system has been trained in the detection of these abnormalities by applying deep learning to healthy and diseased X-rays.
